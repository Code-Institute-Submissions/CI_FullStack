    <h2>Have you ever heard of
      <span>HYGGE
      </span>?
    </h2>
    <p>It is a Norwegian word pronounced ‘hoo-ga’ or ‘hue-gah’. Its meaning stretches between cozyness,
      wellbeing and togetherness -- but these words are not quite accurate.
      Hygge can be defined as creating intimacy in any given moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can experience hygge watching television with a cat on your lap; sitting by the fire with a hot cup
      of
      coffee while there is a storm outside; even when having close friends over for a birthday dinner.
